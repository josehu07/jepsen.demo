# Jepsen Workflow Demos

Jepsen test workflow demos, with hooks to a custom Rust-implemented consistency checker.

Please see the associated Unified, Practical Consistency Levels Model [paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01576), and use the following reference information:

}
```

## Systems

The demos are tested on CloudLab Ubuntu 22.04 machines. The list of currently supported systems is as follows (each may have multiple consistency modes):

- etcd-v3.1
- zookeeper-v3.4
- rabbitmq-v3.8

Make sure they are available under `/home/jepsen/<system-va.b>/` and compiled on all remote data nodes before running a test from the control node. Some systems might not need compiling & installing from source, instead just requiring a package installation.

## Usage

Fill the following hostname files:

- `hosts/host-ctrl`: the control node hostname
- `hosts/hosts-db`: one database node hostname per line

Sync repo content with all hosts:

```bash
just rsync
```

SSH connect to a node:

```bash
just sshto 0  # control node
just sshto 1  # first db node, etc.
```

Run a test workflow from the control node:

```bash
just test <system> [args ...]
```

Run only the checker analysis phase (index `-1` means latest run, etc.):

```bash
just check <index> [args ...]
```

Launch an exploration web server:

```bash
just serve
```

## Results

Example Jepsen outputs of testing runs can be found under `store/` (and browsed through the web server). Their corresponding checker result outputs can be found under `result/`, where the index is the reverse index in web server listing order (`-1` means latest run).
